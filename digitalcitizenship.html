					<li class="digitamain"><p class="digitamain">What is a good digital citizen? A good digital citizen is someone who uses their rights to internet access responsibly and ethically. Essentially no hacking, scamming, bullying, or deceiving. For instance Let's talk about Digital Footprint. Everyone online has a digital footprint. A digital footprint records everything you have done online, which is contained throughout the entire internet.  Jobs can see it, family memebers can see it, everyone can see it. Your digital footprint can be accessed by anyone and can sometimes be used as a judge of character.</p></li>

						<p>Being a good digital citizen is easy! All it takes is a little bit of effort</p>
						<h3>Here Are 5 Easy Steps:</h3>
						<br>
						<ol>
							<li>Do not hack anyone without authorization. There is a form of hacking generally considered legal called "Ethical Hacking" where a hacker has permission from the system owner. But unauthorized hacking is an invasion of privacy and is considered illegal!<sup><a class="link1" href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-48000-computer-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(1)</a></sup></li>
							<li>Do not scam anyone. These include phishing, dating/romance scams, identity theft, credit card fraud, job scams, and much more. If you want to learn more about scams, visit my page on scamming. Scamming is considered fraud and is also illegal.<sup><a class="link1" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(2)</a></sup></li>
							<li>Be nice on the internet. Treat people online like you would want to be treated. Bullying is never ok and can sometimes lead to death. If you ever spot someone who is being bullied online, report it.</li>
							<li>Do not spread misinformation. Spreading misinformation can lead to disorder and destruction within your community. For example, harmful misinformation spread during the COVID-19 pandemic about the vaccine resulted in some people not getting the treatment they needed. For more examples, please read these few articles.<sup><a class="link2" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3213001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(3)</a></sup><sup><a class="link2" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10623619/#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20declining%20trust%20in,2018%3B%20Steensen%2C%202019)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(4)</a></sup><sup><a class="link2" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9359307/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(5)</a></sup></li>
							<li>Do your best to call out these behaviors. If you have spotted any of these behaviors I have mentioned please let your communities know, you could save someone.</li>

						<h3>Internet Addiction</h3>
						<p>Internet addiction is the constant urge or need to browse the web so much that it causes distress to yourself or others. When people are willing to put the Internet over basic needs such as bathing, sleeping, and eating they are addicted to the Internet. Internet addiction can result in loss of relationships and jobs, because of the neglect that would happen to those areas of life. Mental health can also be deteriorated due to the massive amounts of information you may be experiencing at once.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul class="number3">
					<li>
						<h3>Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
						<p>Digital rights and responsibilities are the rights and responsibilities a person must follow when using technology to become a good digital citizen. Those rights include staying safe online, digital access, respectful communication, and property. As a digital citizen, it is your responsibility to respect the rights of others. Meaning not spreading viruses online or stealing artwork from an artist online. Following the rights and responsibilities can make the digital world much better.</p>
